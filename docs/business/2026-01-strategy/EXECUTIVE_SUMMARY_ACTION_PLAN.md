## 💵 Funding Decision Tree

```
Should you raise money?
│
├─► Do you want to maximize personal outcome?
│   │
│   ├─► Yes, exit in 2-3 years
│   │   └─► Don't raise. Bootstrap to $1M ARR, sell for $15-30M
│   │
│   └─► Yes, but willing to wait 5+ years
│       └─► Raise $3M seed at $15M, target $500M+ exit
│
└─► Do you want to build a large company?
    │
    └─► Raise $3M seed now, Series A in 18 months
        Target: Category leader, $1B+ potential
```

### My Recommendation

**Raise a $2-3M seed at $15-20M pre-money.**

Why:

- Accelerates timeline by 12-18 months
- Provides resources to hire and scale
- Creates options (acquisition or growth)
- Downside protected (acqui-hire floor)
- Upside uncapped (100-400x potential)

## 🎪 The Opportunity Window

```
NOW ────────────────────────────────────────────────► CLOSING

✓ MCP just achieved industry-standard status (Dec 2025)
✓ Linux Foundation governance = enterprise trust
✓ 97M+ monthly SDK downloads = massive adoption
✓ No serious Google Sheets MCP competition exists
✓ You have 10-18x more features than anyone

⚠️ Window closes when:
  • Google builds native Gemini integration (6-12 months?)
  • Well-funded competitor enters (3-6 months?)
  • Market consolidates around 2-3 players (12-18 months?)
```

**You have maybe 6 months of clear runway.** First-mover advantage is real, but only if you move first.

## 🤔 Questions to Answer

1. **What's your personal goal?** (Exit vs. build vs. lifestyle)
2. **How much runway do you have?** (Self-funded timeline)
3. **Would you take an acquisition today?** (At what price?)
4. **Can you commit full-time?** (Or is this a side project?)

---

## 🏁 Final Thought

You've built something genuinely valuable. The technical work is done. Now it's about:

1. **Shipping** (get it public)
2. **Storytelling** (make people care)
3. **Selling** (users, customers, or the company)

The market is ready. The product is ready. The only question is: **are you ready to launch?**
